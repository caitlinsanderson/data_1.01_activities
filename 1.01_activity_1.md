Try to answer these questions:

1. What is the difference between list and tuple?
A tuple is an ordered, immutable sequence of objects, meaning the objects 
inside the tuple cannot be changed. 
A list is mutable or changeable, it is possible to change the values of any 
of the objects inside the list. 
Additionally, a list is bordered with straight brackets [] and tuples use 
parenthesis (). 

2. What is the difference between `for` loop and `while` loop?
A 'for' loop executes a code in a loop for a given variable. It is often
used to iterate through a list, tuple, or dictionary.
$for object_a in object_b:
     execute_code
A 'while' loop executes code while a specified condition is true.  This is 
particularly helpful if you want an execution to iterate only over a portion
of a list or tuple or only until a certain condition is met. 
$while condition_a_is_true:
     execute_code 


3. What are the conditional statements in Python?
The conditional statements in Python are if, elif, and else statements.  
$if some_condition:
    execute_code
elif some_other_condition:
    execute_code
else some_last_condition:
    execute_code
